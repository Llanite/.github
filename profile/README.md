## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is a custom game engine which is useful for making basic games. It's currently under high development. It is designed to be as performant and cross-platform as possible.

This is done by using libraries such as:
* [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs)
* [Shipyard](https://crates.io/crates/shipyard)

This allows for multi-threading across the entire engine.

## Interfaces?
There is an interface planned that will be made using the engine itself. The engine is flexible enough that the entire editor will be wrote using Llanite!
